Google Chrome extensions that helps to fill BAC everyday co-worker contact report.


The extension remembers your name and shows you a system notification at selected time. 
On the button click it either fills and send the form automatically (if you didn't meet anyone) or leads you to the co-worker selection page.

v 0.1 features:

- Allows you to select days of the week and a certain time when to show a notification.
- "Default action" option either fills the form and sends it automatically if you worked remotely OR leads you to the page that needs user's manual actions (page with co-workers checkboxes).
- "Play sound" option allows to play a sound together with the notification. Note: Playing sound is a pretty brittle feature and may not work depends on the runtime context (if your current active browser tab is playable etc.) so don't rely only on it.
Current notification sound volume is hardcoded as 10% of your system max volume.

TODO:

- Add non-default action choice for cases when you work on site and remote during the week.
- Add a "co-workers checkboxes pre-fill" button to simplify checkboxes list population. It should keep your last choice of co-workers on every submit.
- Fix: make sure it executes the code only once on onUpdate event.
- Add onRemove listener and clen up after yourself.
- Fix: move from unreliable timeouts to MutationObserver.
- Add visual volume control to the options.
